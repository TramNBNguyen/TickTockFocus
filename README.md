# üçÖ Pomodoro Timer Chrome Extension

> A personal practice project exploring Chrome extension development and the Pomodoro Technique

## üìñ About This Project

This is a fun side project I built to practice web development skills and learn Chrome extension APIs. I wanted to create something I'd actually use daily while exploring new technologies!

The Pomodoro Technique helps break work into focused 25-minute intervals with short breaks. As someone who struggles with productivity, I thought building my own timer would be both useful and educational.

## ‚ú® What It Does

- **25-minute focused work sessions** with automatic break reminders
- **Smart break system**: 5-minute breaks after each session, 15-minute break every 4th session
- **Visual progress tracking** with a clean, animated progress bar
- **Audio notifications** when sessions complete (with fallback browser notifications)
- **Persistent state** - remembers where you left off even if you close the popup
- **Session counting** to track your productivity throughout the day
- **Clean, modern UI** with smooth animations and gradients

## üõ† Technologies & Skills Practiced

- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Classes, async/await, event handling, timers
- **Chrome Extension APIs**: Manifest V3, storage, notifications, background scripts
- **CSS3**: Flexbox, gradients, animations, transitions
- **HTML5**: Semantic markup, accessibility considerations
- **Browser Storage**: Local storage for state persistence
- **Project Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns, modular code structure

## üöÄ Installation & Usage

1. Download or clone this repository
2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Enable "Developer mode" in the top right
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the project folder
5. Click the extension icon in your toolbar to start focusing!

**Usage Tips:**
- Click "Start" to begin a 25-minute work session
- Use "Pause" and "Reset" as needed
- Let it run in the background - state is saved automatically
- Audio notification plays when sessions end (enable notifications if prompted)

## üéØ What I Learned

Building this extension taught me:
- How Chrome extensions work under the hood (manifest, permissions, APIs)
- Managing application state and persistence
- Creating smooth user interactions with CSS animations
- Handling browser notifications and audio
- Writing clean, maintainable JavaScript classes
- Planning and completing a full-stack project from scratch

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

Some ideas I'm considering for v2:
- [ ] Customizable work/break durations
- [ ] Daily/weekly productivity statistics
- [ ] Different notification sounds
- [ ] Dark/light theme toggle
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts
- [ ] Integration with task management apps

## ü§î Why This Project?

As a developer, I believe in building things you actually want to use. This project combines:
- **Practical utility** - I use it daily for focused work sessions
- **Technical learning** - Great introduction to Chrome APIs and browser development
- **Portfolio value** - Demonstrates full-stack thinking and project completion
- **Problem solving** - Tackles a real productivity challenge many people face

## üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è About Me

This project is part of my journey learning web development and exploring different technologies. I enjoy building small, useful tools that solve everyday problems while expanding my technical skills.

Feel free to fork this repo, suggest improvements, or just use it to boost your own productivity!
